        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>"Seen this classic so many times and never ceases to get old. With a bunch of great scenery, adorableness, original vibes,
         and comedy! Macaulay Culkin shined so much, he deserved the millions earned for his role. I love how Joe Pesci went from
        Scorsese films where he swore so much where as in this he had to bite his tongue. John Hughe was a gifted writer that helmed 
        some gems!" - IMDb</p>
        <p>"Home Alone" is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas 
        holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe. At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when 
        he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house. However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-
        old and he has plans for them when they attack. Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.
        This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it 
        that much more special. All the performers do well and in the end the film also does. - IMDb</p>
